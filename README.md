# Comparative-Analysis-of-Clustering-Techniques-for-Binary-Feature-Datasets
09615: Computational Modeling, Statistical Analysis, and ML course  
- Conducted k-means clustering and determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. Explored various clustering techniques (Agglomerative, DBSCAN, etc.) and distance metrics (Cosine, Jaccard) to assess their suitability for the dataset. 
- Applied dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP) to visualize results and compared clustering outcomes to understand the impact of different methods and metrics.
Tools Used: Python, scikit-learn, t-SNE, UMAP, Pandas, Matplotlib
